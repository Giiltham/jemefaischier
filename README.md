you can either download the apk from the releases or build the project yourself.  

The landing page allows you to access a map which shows cafés in Lyon, or you can directly go to your favorite locations.  
  
We also show the value of the gravity sensor at the bottom of the landing page, it has no use.  
  
On the map you can touch markers, which will show a card containing the name of the café and buttons :
* favorite: Always there, add the location to your favorites
* website: optional, redirect you to the location website

You also have access to two buttons, one to go back to the landing page, and another to go to your favorites

On the favorite screen, you can see all you favorites, delete them, and also touch them to be redirected to their location on the map.
